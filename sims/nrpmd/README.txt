nrpmd simultion folder was created to generate figures for Nandini's review article circa July 2021. This folder implements
mvrpmd style equilibration and sampling with nrpmd dynamics.

Because I am in a pinch to write this code and we are using mvrpmd equilibrium and sampling,
nrpmd.cpp borrows mvrpmd code without changing the name. This is why mvrpmd will appear
throughout the code.
